by core contributors and only as a result of collective deliberation.

2. Without discussion with other contributors AND explicit permission from the
core contributors, it’s forbidden to disclose anything from the following
resources (private resources):

    - Direct messages

you’re not allowed to fork private repositories or clone them. The publication
of open-source code can only be authorized by core contributors after

not officially published, it’s not allowed to recreate music, redraw images,
